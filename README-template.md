## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked.
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Experience smooth animations when expanding or collapsing the FAQ sections.
- Benefit from accessible features such as ARIA attributes for screen readers.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - For animations
- Accessibility features (ARIA attributes)

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of:

- Implementing smooth animations using GSAP.
- Enhancing accessibility with ARIA attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-hidden`.
- Structuring React components for reusability (`FAQ_Card` and `FAQ_Collapse`).
- Managing state in React to control UI behavior.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I used GSAP for smooth animations:

```tsx
useGSAP(() => {
  if (!faqContentRef.current) return;
  const contentHeight = faqContentRef.current.scrollHeight;
  if (isOpen) {
    gsap.to(faqContentRef.current, {
      height: contentHeight,
      duration: 0.25,
      ease: "power3.inOut",
      onStart: () => {
        faqContentRef.current!.style.overflow = "hidden";
      },
      onComplete: () => {
        faqContentRef.current!.style.overflow = "visible";
      },
    });
  } else {
    gsap.to(faqContentRef.current, {
      height: 0,
      duration: 0.25,
      ease: "power3.inOut",
      onStart: () => {
        faqContentRef.current!.style.overflow = "hidden";
      },
    });
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore more advanced animation techniques with GSAP.
- Further improve accessibility by testing with screen readers.
- Implement unit tests for components to ensure reliability.

### Useful resources

- [GSAP Documentation](https://greensock.com/docs/) - Helped me understand how to implement animations effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs: ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - Provided guidance on making the FAQ accessible.
